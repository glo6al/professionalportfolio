Welcome to my professional portfolio! This website showcases some of my work as a web developer. In the My Work section, you'll find links to my professional businesses, where I have developed two websites.

I have also worked to make this website responsive for both desktop and mobile devices. To do this, I have employed a number of different breakpoints for various screen sizes. My professional logo is proudly displayed in the center of the navbar, and I have broken down the body of the HTML file into a header, main, and footer section.

Screenshot below demonstrates the default breakpoints for different desktop screens.

I want the website to natrually respond to the screen as you might shrink it when grab and drag a bwoser window. So, I implemented a number of different breakpoints.
